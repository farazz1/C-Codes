TOP PICK:

1. Online Exam System
This project is a complete Online Exam System written in C++. It is a web-based system that enables users to set up tests,
 administer tests, view and grade results, and analyze performance data. Users can set up tests with multiple questions,
 including objective and essay questions. A Timer for each test can be generated and can randomly select questions from a
 large pool of questions. It also allows users to leave comments on the test results for further analysis. The system also
 allows the administrator to publish test results and print out a summary. It records exam answers, multiple choice, and short
 answer questions, time spent, and marks obtained. With this system, users will be able to take the exams with ease and accuracy.

Technologies Required: C++ programming language, Database Management System(DBMS), JavaScript Libraries, Testing Frameworks, and Web Servers.
